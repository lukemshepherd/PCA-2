# Functions

## mag:

Finds magnitude of vector

## angle:

Finds the angel between two vectors

## quaternion_rotation_from_angle

`(v, c_axis, theta)`:

v = vector np.array 1x3

`c_axis` = cross product between two principle conponets 

`theta` = angle of rotation (radians) 

## voxel_rotate

Alines and rotates bone_f1 to bone_f2

(bone_f1, bone_f2):

bone = bone class object
